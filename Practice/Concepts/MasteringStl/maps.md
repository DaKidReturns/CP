Maps
=====

### Introduction
Maps stores values as key value pairs \<key, value\>. In C++ there are 2 kinds of maps  
1. Ordered maps -> sortes on the basis of key
2. Unordered maps -> sortes on the basis of values

Key is not a index it is a parameter which is hashed. Internally ordered map uses bal. BST

Hashing or any comparison is done on 'Keys'. Unordered map is same as dict in python
