# Concepts

This is the folder where I practice new concepts realted to Competitive Programming. Mainly the using datastructures and algorithms to solve problems
and there wont be any implementation of the said algorithm (If it is available in the standard library) or any [practice probelms][problem-folder-link]  
If you are curious (I wonder why) to checkout my implementation of some of the algorithms then [go to this repo here][DS-repo-link]
