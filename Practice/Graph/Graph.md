# Graph

### Inroduction
------------------
A graph is a pair of sets, (V,E). Where V is the set of Vertices and E is the set of Edges connecting the pairs of vertices.  

### Terminology
----------------
##### Vertices
A vertex or node, it is the fundamental unit of a graph

##### Edges
A edge, each edge has two or more(in the case of hypergraphs) nodes to which it is attached, called **endpoints**.  
Edges may be directed or undirected. **Directed Edges** are called arrows or arcs and **Undirected Edges** are called lines.  

##### Parallel Edges
If a pair of vertices are connected by more than one edge then those edges are *parallel edges*

##### Self Loops
If the edge connects the vertex to itself then it is a self loop

##### Walks

##### Trails

##### Paths
