I don't know why you are here, because, unless you are me you won't be able to navigate through the files in this repository, but if
you are here because I asked you to check somthing out please don't be alarmed and continue, if someone else told you about this, repo
hurray for me (they must be really desperate) and if you were looking at some of my other stuff and reached here then ok.

### Introduction
All the (almost all) the problems solved by me on various competative programming sites will be in this repo and feel free to you use it
as you wish, there is no license (if you really want one, then I am sorry) on any of the solutions. 

##### Note
If there is a paragraph above the introduction and you are offended by it (can't see any reason why), it won't be removed)
